This blog is made for Ken Bauer's class: Programming Fundamentals TC101.

## Where do they assign what one has to do?
Ken actually created a blog outside Blackboard, TEC's personal learning tool, where he post the assignments to do. [Click here to check it out][http://kenscourses.com/tc101winter2016/]

## WSQ
This type of documents are the homeworks posted in the Ken's blog.

## Personal Blog
We also had to keep blogging what we do, and we also have to explain it. [Click here to check my personal blog][https://rhcpalmarichiewordpresscom.wordpress.com/]

## What is the quality of the files?

To beggin with, the author of this repository is starting programming from 0%, so for a professional programmer this may actually look unprofessional and low quality. Yet, each code accomplishes it's purpose.
